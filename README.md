# GrubDash
This GrubDash project is one of the challenges for the backend development modules within the Thinkful Software Engineering Immersion program of study.  The premise of the project is that GrubDash is a start-up restaurant food delivery service.  

The developer is challenged with the tasks of setting up and API and building out specific routes so that the frontend developers can demo the initial designs.

The frontend code for the project can be found at this link: [GrubDash Frontend](https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/starter-grub-dash-front-end)
